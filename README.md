# Status

This project is **UNMAINTAINED** and won't receive further updates or bug fixes.

For the record, I was using this crate to provide SIMD acceleration to the stats.rs crate. But later
that got removed because SIMD is not usable in the stable channel.

Not really a replacement, but you may be interested in the [simd] crate on crates.io.
